# spring-boot-filter-for-ping-intelligence
This is a filter for a microservice built with spring boot. It collects metadata of api traffic flowing through the  micoservice it is running alongside and feeds it to an  external API Security Enforcer (ASE). The ASE is a component  of Ping Identity's Ping Intelligence for APIs which build  machine learning models of your APIs to look for anomalies.

This is an example only - not supported code.
